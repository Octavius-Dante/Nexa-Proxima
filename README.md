#### Node JS - Overview

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that enables JavaScript to be executed outside of a web browser. Historically, JavaScript was primarily designed to run within web browsers to add interactivity to websites. Node.js, built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, extracted this engine to allow JavaScript code to be run on servers, in command-line tools, and for various other applications that traditionally required other programming languages.
Therefore, Node.js does not "help" JavaScript to run in the sense of assisting it within its native browser environment. Instead, Node.js provides a new environment where JavaScript can run in contexts beyond the browser, effectively extending its utility to server-side development and other non-browser applications.
